Security Algorithm Details

1) Salt Generation
-> Details:
	Salt Length = 16
-> Algorithm: 
	random string from specified alphanumeric characters

2) UUID Generation
-> Algorithm:
	uuid generated from host ID, sequence number and current time

3) Hash Generation
-> Algorithm:
	message is serialized to string form
	salt is concatenated to the message
	message is hashed using SHA256

4) Shared Key Algorithm (SKA)
-> Details:
	Encryption Algorithm: AES-CBC
	Signing Algorithm: HMAC-SHA256
	Key Size: 192
	Signature Size: Digest size of SHA256
	AES Block Size: 16
-> Encryption Algorithm:
	Message is serialized and padded to proper length
	Message is encrypted using shared key
	Message signature is generated using shared key and encrypted data
	Message signature is concatenated to the encrypted message
	Encrpted message with signature is returned
-> Decryption Algorithm:
	Signature and encrypted message are separated
	Message signature is verified
	Message is decrypted using the shared key
	Message is deserialized
	Deserialized message is returned

5) Public Key Algorithm (PKA)
-> Details:
	Encryption Algorithm: RSA
	Signing Algorithm: HMAC-SHA256
	Key Size: 2048
-> Encryption Algorithm
	Message is serialized
	Message is encrypted using public key
	Message signature is generated using public key and encrypted data
	Message signature is concatenated to the encrypted message
	Encrpted message with signature is returned
-> Decryption Algorithm
	Signature and decrypted message are separated
	Message signature is verified
	Message is decrypted using the private key
	Message is deserialized
	Deserialized message is returned
-> Signing Algorithm
	Message is serialized to string
	Message is hashed with SHA256
	Hashed message is signed using private key
	Signature is returned
-> Verification Algorithm
	Message is serialized to string
	Message is hashed with SHA256
	Signature is verified
